<ol class="tos_list">
	<li>
		<h1>Legal Agreement:</h1>
		<p>Your use of the Site is subject at all times to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. Any content, including but not limited to, user identities created on the Site or submitted to the Service is governed by these Terms. This includes, but is not limited to, proper in-game and out of game conduct. This Agreement is in addition to, and does in no way replace or supplant, the End User License Agreement (the "EULA") that accompanied the KingOfFighter software and to which the KingOfFighter software is subject. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other KingOfFighter services, affiliate services, third-party content or software.</p>
		<p>KingOfFighter recommends that all users periodically review these Terms since KingOfFighter is a live and evolving community. KingOfFighter reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to revise, amend, change, add to, delete, or update these terms and the Service, effective with or without prior notice by publishing the revised or updated Agreement on our website at KingOfFighter. The revised or updated Agreement is effective upon publication and your continued use of the Site and the Service following notice and publication of the revised or updated Agreement on the site will constitute your acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with these revised or updated Terms, you are obligated to terminate your User ID immediately and cancel any services for which you have signed up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Eligibility and Age Requirements:</h3>
		<p>The Site and the Service are for users age 13 and over. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 2000, if you are under the age of 13, personal information cannot be collected from you and thus, you are prohibited from creating a membership account through the Service, shall not be eligible to enter any prize awarding events and/or promotions, and are asked not to provide any personal information of any kind on the Site, through the Service, or to us.</p>
		<p>As noted, the Site and the Service are for users age 13 and over. While children of all ages may view the Site, only those 13 or older can use the Site and related games and services. We will not knowingly accept any applications or other submissions from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that anyone under the age of 13 is attempting to make an application or place an order, we will terminate the transaction if it is feasible to do so and subsequently delete any personal information sent to us. Also, we do not knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use personal information regarding children under the age of 13 on this Site.</p>
		<p>If a parent or legal guardian of a child discovers that their child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information and would like KingOfFighter to stop collecting such information, or have the child's personal information deleted from our database records, they should contact us at <font color="white">gm@playKingOfFighter.com</font>. We will review, update, or remove the child's information as requested within reasonable time.</p>
		<p>If you are over the age of 13, but still considered a minor under the law of the relevant state, we ask that you review these Terms as well as our Privacy Policy with your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to ensure they understand and agree to them. We strongly encourage parents or legal guardians to be positive and active role models to their children and spend time together online with their children, familiarizing themselves with the Service and overseeing any communication between their children and any other Internet users. It is highly suggested that parents or legal guardians educate their children about online conduct, specifically including but not limited to, never revealing, distributing, or otherwise communicating their personal identifying information such as real names, images, addresses, or phone numbers without parental or guardian permission when using the Internet.</p>
		<p>KingOfFighter is an ever-evolving community comprised of many different participants with different experiences and backgrounds. While we may choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate player conduct, chat or links to the Service, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the Service that may be inappropriate for children or offensive to some users of any age. This agreement outlines rules of conduct for players accessing the Service. We cannot ensure that all players will adhere to these terms and not provide content or access to content that parents or guardians may find inappropriate or that any user may find objectionable. KingOfFighter does not pre-screen the content, the materials or the communications transmitted by each player. As such, it is highly encouraged that parents provide guidance to users under the age of majority and exercise their parental responsibility in restricting access of their children to such content.</p>

		<h3>User Identity/Account Creation:</h3>
		<p>When creating a user identity ("User ID", "account") by completing and submitting the KingOfFighter registration form, you represent that you have reviewed, understand, and are in full compliance with the Terms. You must also provide truthful and accurate information in the registration process and be who you claim to be. If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must preside over your registration process and/or complete the registration process for you, in which case they will take full responsibility for all obligations under this Agreement and are completely liable for all activities conducted through the Account by you or any other party, whether authorized by the registered user or not.</p>
		<p>During the registration process, you must select login information ("Login Information") comprised of a unique login name ("User ID," "account name") and a secure password ("password").</p>
		<p>As creator of your User ID, you are completely responsible for your identity and KingOfFighter will not tolerate offensive, obscene, or otherwise inappropriate user identities. If a User ID violates any part of these Terms, determined at the sole and absolute discretion of KingOfFighter Support Staff, we may immediately, temporarily, or permanently ban such User ID from the Site or Service, with or without notice or prior warning.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Account Security:</h3>
		<p>You, as the registered user of an account, are ultimately and completely responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your login information and computer system used to access the Site or Service. Further, you are solely responsible and liable for any and all uses of your Login Information, whether authorized by you or not. You may not directly or indirectly reveal your password to anyone for any reason at any time or allow anyone else to access the account. Sharing, trading, swapping, selling, buying, bartering, or otherwise distributing accounts or account/Login Information is strictly prohibited and subject to disciplinary action up to and possibly including service termination at the sole and absolute discretion of our support staff. KingOfFighter will NEVER ask for your account password and you should NEVER reveal it, EVER; even when contacting us about an account issue.</p>
		<p>When creating a User ID, you agree to indemnify and hold KingOfFighter and its affiliates harmless for any improper use of such identity including, but not limited to, improper or illegal use by someone to whom you have revealed your password in any way. KingOfFighter is not responsible for any misuse of your User ID, whether such misuse is by you or by third parties. When interacting in any online community we strongly recommend that all players think before they click and engage in safe internet practices at all times.</p>
		<p>If you discover that the confidentiality of your account Login Information may have been compromise, you are required to immediately and truthfully report this to KingOfFighter as soon as possible by emailing or submitting a request for help through the KingOfFighter Helpdesk.

		<p>KingOfFighter can and does issue warnings and temporary suspensions and permanent terminations of user identities for user violations. We retain the sole discretion as to when and how to impose warnings, penalties and/or disciplinary actions. The severity of a violation and number of occurrences factor into the decisions, but they are not the only measures used. User identities may be banned, both temporarily and permanently, without prior warning.</p>
		<p>To avoid any doubt, you acknowledge that KingOfFighter has sole discretion with respect to penalties and disciplinary actions even if there is a credit remaining on your account.</p>
		<p>If you feel you or your User ID has been unfairly warned or disciplined, please submit a request for help at the KingOfFighter Helpdesk or send an email with pertinent detail to  <font color="white">gm@playKingOfFighter.com</font>. All submitted account action disputes will be carefully reviewed yet KingOfFighter will only take action with valid claims in its determination.</p>
