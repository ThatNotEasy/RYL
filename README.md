# RiskYourLife (RYL) - Personal Security Research Project

## ⚠️ Important Notice
This project **does not** involve game development or content modification. It is focused exclusively on **security research** and **penetration testing** within the RiskYourLife (RYL) MMORPG. Some portions of the project are not made public to prevent conflicts within the game development community.

## 📝 Credits
- **Youxiland**: Original *RiskYourLife* game developer
- **Gamasoft**: Publisher and game maintainer

## Overview
This is a **self-learning project** dedicated to **penetration testing** and **security research** of the *RiskYourLife (RYL)* MMORPG infrastructure. The goal is to explore the security mechanisms of the game from both the client and server sides—not to create or alter game content.

## Focus Areas
- 🔒 **Penetration Testing**: Identify and assess vulnerabilities in RYL systems
- 🛡️ **Security Research**: Study and understand game security mechanisms
- 🔍 **Reverse Engineering**: Analyze protocols, data structures, and communication
- 📊 **Database Analysis**: Inspect game data flow and structures
- 🌐 **Network Analysis**: Examine client-server interactions

## Learning Goals
- Understand MMORPG security architecture and protocols
- Master penetration testing methodologies for online games
- Study common vulnerabilities in game databases and network communications
- Develop tools and scripts for security testing

## Project Structure

### Self-Modules/
A set of tools and scripts for in-depth RYL analysis:
- **Database Tools**: MySQL/SQL Server connectors for data investigation
- **File Converters**: Process RYL2 item scripts and text files
- **Security Tools**: Vulnerability scanners and connection testers
- **Data Migration**: Tools for analyzing game data formats and structures

### Server-Side/
Original game server files and web interfaces for security research.

### Client-Side/
Game client files to study and test security vulnerabilities.

## Key Notes
- ⚠️ **For Educational Purposes Only**: This project is focused on **learning** and **research**.
- 🔒 **No Exploitation**: The aim is to **understand** security flaws, not to exploit them.
- 📚 **Self-Learning**: A personal project for skill development.
- 🎯 **Pentesting Focus**: Concentrated on security testing, not game development.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Automation and scripting
- **Database Analysis**: MySQL, SQL Server tools
- **Network Protocol Analysis**: Capturing and inspecting client-server communication
- **Reverse Engineering**: File format and protocol analysis
- **Security Frameworks**: Penetration testing frameworks
