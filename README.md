# RiskYourLife (RYL) - Personal Self-Learning Project

## Overview
This is a **personal self-learning project** focused on **penetration testing** and security research of the RiskYourLife (RYL) MMORPG game. This project is **NOT focused on game development** but rather on understanding, analyzing, and testing the security aspects of the RYL game infrastructure.

## Project Focus
- 🔒 **Penetration Testing** - Identifying and analyzing security vulnerabilities
- 🛡️ **Security Research** - Understanding game security mechanisms
- 🔍 **Reverse Engineering** - Analyzing game protocols and data structures
- 📊 **Database Analysis** - Examining game database structures and data flow
- 🌐 **Network Analysis** - Studying client-server communication patterns

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding MMORPG security architecture
- Learning penetration testing methodologies for game servers
- Analyzing database security in gaming environments
- Researching common vulnerabilities in online gaming systems
- Developing security testing tools and scripts

## Project Structure

### Self-Modules/
Contains various tools and scripts for analyzing RYL game components:
- **Database Tools** - MySQL/SQL Server connectors and analyzers
- **File Converters** - RYL2 itemscript and text file processors
- **Security Tools** - Connection testers and vulnerability scanners
- **Data Migration** - Tools for analyzing game data structures

### Server-Side/
Original RYL game server files and web interface for research purposes.

### Client-Side/
Game client files for analysis and testing.

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Educational Purpose Only** - This project is for learning and research
- 🔒 **No Exploitation** - Focus is on understanding, not exploiting vulnerabilities
- 📚 **Self-Learning** - Personal project for skill development
- 🎯 **Pentesting Focus** - Security testing rather than development

## Tools & Technologies
- Python scripting for automation
- Database analysis (MySQL, SQL Server)
- Network protocol analysis
- File format reverse engineering
- Security testing frameworks

## RYL Macros Project
This project includes **RYL-compatible macros** for all RiskYourLife game versions:

🔗 **[RiskYourLife Macros Repository](https://github.com/ThatNotEasy/riskyourlife-macros)**

### Macro Features
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility** - Works with all RYL game versions
- 🎮 **Core AFK Farming** - Advanced automated farming system
- ⚡ **Multi-Feature Integration** - All farming tools in one comprehensive macro
- 🔧 **Highly Customizable** - Easy to modify for different farming strategies
- 🛡️ **Safe & Undetected** - Designed to avoid anti-cheat detection

### Core Functionality
- **AFK Farming Engine** - Automated resource gathering and experience farming
- **Multi-Map Support** - Works across different game locations
- **Smart Pathing** - Intelligent movement and positioning
- **Loot Management** - Automatic inventory and drop handling
- **Anti-AFK Detection** - Built-in mechanisms to avoid detection

## Getting Started
This project is organized for security research and analysis. Each module can be used independently for specific testing scenarios.
