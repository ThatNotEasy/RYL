- Here's a more detailed and clear version of your instructions in English:

- Decrypt the monsterscript.gcf file using the latest release of "mcfcoder".
- Open the decrypted file in a hex editor.
- Find the monster's name that you need in the hex editor.
- The marker "DD 6D" indicates the point of interest.
- The monster's ID is located immediately before "DD 6D".
- For the Korean client, the monster "sakan" has an ID of 40000, which corresponds to the binary code "40 9C".
- The next step is to edit the server file monsterscript.txt:
- The entry should look like "40000 sakan x .. .....".
- In place of ...., insert Hydra's information.
